docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker logs -f nav-scoring
```

## 📁 File Locations (Inside Container)

- **Database:** `/app/data/navs.db`
- **GPX Uploads:** `/app/data/gpx_uploads/`
- **PDF Reports:** `/app/data/pdf_reports/`
- **Config:** `/app/data/config.yaml`

**On Host (Unraid):**
- **Database:** `/mnt/user/appdata/nav_scoring/data/navs.db`
- **Config:** `/mnt/user/appdata/nav_scoring/data/config.yaml`

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Database locked" error
**Solution:** Restart container
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Email not sending
**Checklist:**
- [ ] Correct SMTP host (smtp.zoho.com)
- [ ] Correct port (587)
- [ ] App password (not main password)
- [ ] Sender email matches Zoho account
- [ ] Check container logs: `docker logs nav-scoring`

### GPX parsing fails
**Common issues:**
- GPX file is corrupted (re-export from GPS)
- No track points in file (check in GPX viewer)
- Wrong file format (must be .gpx, not .kml or .fit)

### PDF not generating
**Check:**
- Matplotlib installed: `docker exec nav-scoring pip list | grep matplotlib`
- Plot file exists: `docker exec nav-scoring ls /app/data/pdf_reports/`
- Container has write permissions
